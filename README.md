# TheNightBeforeChristmas_DEMO_MODE

A Tree or string light display for 2020 using FastLED.

-Fits and runs on any 328p and above- 
(UNO,NANO,PRO-MINI,MEGA,ESP8266 & ESP32)

This version: 

Fixes uploading error to ESP boards.

Has minor tweaks to tidy up the code,

Fixes a few spelling errors, 

Removed random spaces, 

Adds better description of patterns, 

Has the correct naming for the sketch from download

(Now you just need to delete "-main" on the folders names)... 

Sorry new-b uploader here! 

Always Learning!

Note:

Default COLOR_ORDER = RGB - 

PLEASE CHECK YOUR LEDS COLOR ORDER, 
PATTERNS MAY DISPLAY WEIRD COLORS IF INCORRECT! 

(compare to pattern list to confirm colors are displaying correct & change to suit your needs).

(Some leds are GRB instead!.... Wrong color order looks "different" but just ruins many patterns!)
